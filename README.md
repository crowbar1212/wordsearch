
This program generates a 12*12 word search

In order to replicate this program, do the following: 
    -Install Visual Studio Code
    -Install Python and Github extensions
    -Sign-in and connect to an existing Github account and repository
    -Import the random and RandomWords libraries. RandomWords is from random_word
    -For enabling random word generation (not currently working), enable the parameters for ensuring that generated words have a dictionary definition ie are actual words not random strings, set a limit of how many words are generated and their maximum length
    -Set function that lists the letters used in generating the word search
    -Set function that orders the columns/rows and borders of the word search 
    -Set function that adds defined or generated words to the word search
